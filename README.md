## Contributing

The code isn't written with production-level usage in mind (I wrote it for myself initially), so if you find bugs or ways to harden it, I'm happy to accept pull requests.

I am also happy to review code for other brokers / banks. The code has some minimal branching already, to facilitate support of multiple different sources (with the anticipation that CSV exports from other brokers would likely differ in format).
